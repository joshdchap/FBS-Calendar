# FBS-Calendar
A simple calendar front-end

To use: 
- Clone or Download to a local directory. 
- Open the index.html file in a browser.
- Click on any day in the calendar to see the list of times for that day.
- click on 'edit' in any time slot to either create or edit the appointment for that time.
- click on 'save' to save your appointment to the calendar.
- Don't refresh or you lose your data.



Original specs:

Write a calendar application using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The user interface should generally have two panes.  One pane should have a calendar with clickable days, and the other should have time slots for a selected day.  The time slots can be in any increment you wish - hourly, 30-minutes, 15-minutes, etc. Each time slot must be able to have a text message attached to be able to make appointments.

A walk-through of a sample use of this application is as follows. The user clicks on a day on the calendar, say, November 25th. The time slot panel updates to reflect the appointments for that day. The user then has the ability to edit an appointment for a given time slot, even for a slot that has no prior appointment.

The instructions are purposefully vague to provide freedom to design the user interface with whatever controls, graphics, and usability characteristics you feel are best.

While the page may be written using whatever techniques you think work best, the following are desirable, but not necessary, attributes:
Page makes use of style sheets (external, internal, or in-line). However, visual design is not a major consideration with this project.
Page renders similarly and functions in major browsers, using the same code (IE, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari)
Page does not use cookies
Page does not submit to any forms
Page uses JavaScript objects or local storage to store the scheduling data (data does not need to be persistent through a browser refresh)
Page does not use plugins such as Flash, or anything proprietary to a single browser such as VBScript in IE, but you may use JavaScript toolkits such as jQuery and calendar plugins
